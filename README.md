# Golos Explorer

[Golos Explorer](https://explorer.golos.id/) - this service for viewing transactions blockchain Golos in real-time. This platform is a thin client, that works without a backend (only frontend and blockchain).

The service is written in Pure JavaScript (native), without the use of frameworks and additional libraries for writing code.

* [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror) - is a versatile text editor implemented in JavaScript for the browser;
* [IcoMoon](https://github.com/Keyamoon/IcoMoon-Free) - perfect vector icons (fonts, SVG).
